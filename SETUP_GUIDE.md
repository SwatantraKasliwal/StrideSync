# StrideSync - FINAL WORKING VERSION

## 🚀 COMPLETE SETUP GUIDE

### Arduino Setup (HC-05 + Buzzer)

#### 1. Hardware Wiring

```
HC-05 Bluetooth Module:
  VCC → Arduino 5V
  GND → Arduino GND
  TXD → Arduino Pin 2 (RX)
  RXD → Arduino Pin 3 (TX)

Buzzer:
  + → Arduino Pin 4
  - → Arduino GND
```

#### 2. Code Upload Steps

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Follow these steps exactly!

1. **DISCONNECT** HC-05 TX/RX wires (pins 2&3) first
2. Open Arduino IDE
3. Upload `StrideSync_HC05_Final.ino`
4. **RECONNECT** HC-05 TX/RX wires after successful upload
5. Open Serial Monitor (9600 baud)
6. Look for: `✅ System ready - waiting for commands`

### Web Application Setup

#### 1. Start the Server

```bash
npm install
npm run dev -- -p 3001
```

#### 2. Open Application

- Go to: `http://localhost:3001`
- Use Chrome browser (required for Bluetooth)
- Make sure Bluetooth is enabled on your computer

#### 3. Connect to Device

1. Click "Scan for Devices"
2. Select "HI TECH" device from list
3. Click "Connect"
4. Wait for green "Connected" status

## 🔧 ALL FIXES APPLIED

### ✅ Data Reception Fixed

- **Better message filtering**: Only processes actual data messages
- **Duplicate transmission**: Arduino sends data twice for reliability
- **Robust parsing**: Handles special characters and formatting issues
- **Real-time display**: Data appears immediately on dashboard

### ✅ Page Refresh Issue Fixed

- **Connection persistence**: Bluetooth stays connected on page refresh
- **Automatic recovery**: App tries to reconnect existing device
- **No data loss**: Session continues after refresh

### ✅ Connection Stability Fixed

- **Alternative UUIDs**: Supports different HC-05 module types
- **Better error handling**: Clear error messages and recovery
- **Connection queue**: Prevents command conflicts

### ✅ Project Cleaned

- **Removed 20+ unnecessary files**: All debug/test files deleted
- **Clean codebase**: Only essential files remain
- **Optimized structure**: Easy to maintain and understand

## 🧪 Testing Your Setup

### 1. Arduino Serial Monitor Test

You should see these messages every few seconds:

```
👟 Steps: 123 | Power: 25.6mV
📤 Data sent (2x): STEPS:123,POWER:25.67,BUZZER:0
```

### 2. Web Application Test

- **Step Counter**: Should increase every 3 seconds
- **Power Chart**: Should show live power generation
- **Buzzer Control**: Toggle switch should work immediately
- **Device Status**: Should show "Connected to HI TECH"

### 3. Command Test

- Click buzzer toggle in web app
- Arduino Serial Monitor should show: `📨 Command received: 'BUZZER_ON'`
- Buzzer should beep immediately

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Arduino Issues

**No Serial Output?**

- Check Arduino power LED
- Verify correct COM port selected
- Ensure HC-05 TX/RX disconnected during upload

**Buzzer Not Working?**

- Check buzzer wiring (Pin 4, GND)
- Test with TEST command
- Verify buzzer polarity

### Web App Issues

**Connection Failed?**

- Use Chrome browser only
- Enable Bluetooth on computer
- Check HC-05 LED is blinking (ready to pair)
- Try refreshing page and reconnecting

**No Data Received?**

- Check Arduino Serial Monitor for "📤 Data sent"
- Look for data in browser console (F12)
- Verify HC-05 TX/RX wires reconnected after upload

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### Every 2 seconds:

- Arduino sends: `STEPS:X,POWER:Y.Z,BUZZER:0`
- Web app receives and displays data
- Step count increases, power chart updates

### Buzzer Commands:

- Web app → `BUZZER_ON` → Arduino
- Arduino turns buzzer ON immediately
- Buzzer state shows in web app

### Page Refresh:

- Connection maintained
- Data continues streaming
- No reconnection needed
